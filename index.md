The Ronald Tickner Educational Trust exists to advance the study of music by the provision of a bursary or bursaries to organ scholars or piano accompanists who should be born, educated or domiciled in the County of Somerset.

Scholars should have attained at least Grade 7 with merit or distinction in the proposed study and they will be expected to contribute to music in the community of Somerset by arrangement with the Trust. The Trust also provides bursaries for the choristers of St Mary Magdalene Church, Taunton, for the study of piano, organ, and other music instruments including singing lessons.

The Trust is a member of Taunton Association of Performing Arts (TAPA).
