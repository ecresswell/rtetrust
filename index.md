The Ronald Tickner Educational Trust was formed in 2000 to commemorate Ron Tickner’s legacy of encouraging young musicians.

It exists to advance the study of music by the provision of bursaries to organists or collaborative pianists from Somerset.

The Trust also provides bursaries for the choristers of Taunton Minster (St Mary Magdalene Church, Taunton) for the study of piano, organ, singing and other instrumental lessons.

Applicants should

- be born, educated or domiciled in the County of Somerset
- be under 25 years of age
- have achieved at least Grade 5 in the proposed study (this requirement does not apply to the choristers of Taunton Minster)
- expect to contribute to music in the community in Somerset by arrangement with the Trust whilst they are in receipt of a bursary from the Trust

Eligible applicants will be invited to play 2 – 3 pieces in an audition, which will take place at Taunton Minster by arrangement with at least two Trustees.

Please note that, if your application is successful, the Trust will request a written report from your teacher at the end of each term, as the Trust monitors the progress of award-holders.
