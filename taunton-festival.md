The Trust is delighted to be associated with the Taunton Festival of the Arts, formerly Taunton & Somerset Music, Drama & Dance Festival.

In 2013 the Festival celebrated their Centenary and hosted, amongst many other events, an Organ Day with William Whitehead, professor of Organ and Trinity College of Music. A report of the day including pictures is available on [the Festival website][organ-event].

The Festival is currently organising the schedule of events for 2015 which promises to be an exciting year, including for the first time a Film Festival. Please see the Festivalâ€™s website for more details.
