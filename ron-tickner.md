Ron Tickner was also a tireless supporter and accompanist for the Taunton & Somerset Music, Drama & Dance Festival.

The Trust was formed in 2000 to commemorate a true Man of Music whose time was so often spent encouraging young musicians. Although primarily an organist, his taste in music was catholic. He had a passion and detailed knowledge of French opera- was as happy playing in a Music Hall as rendering Joplin rags -or as repetiteur for the huge range of performances undertaken by Somerset Opera, Britten, Wagner, Verdi, Mozart, G&S, Slade, Berkeley, Holst, Delius, Lambert amongst many others. He created the stage persona of Cpl, Tickner in the Private Willis shows, (G&S with audience participation,) which were performed all over the West Country and even travelled to France, much to the bemusement of the natives.
