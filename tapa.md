The Trust is delighted to be associated and involved with the Taunton Association of Performing Arts. The main role of the Association is to produce a diary of arts events taking place in the surrounding area.

The diary is produced online – <http://www.tapa.org.uk> – and is available to members and the public. In addition the Association produces a brochure of events three times a year which is available at all events organised by members.

The Association, founded by Brian Cresswell in 1998 now has over 30 Full and Associate members.
